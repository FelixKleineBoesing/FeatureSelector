# Feature Selector

#### Warning! Heavy Development! WIP!
This is package which handles an auomatic feature selection.
Feel free to contribute. 


There are different algorithms that are used in this package. 
These are the following:


**Neighborhood-Search**

Inspect the whole feature space and chooses the best configuration. Guaranteed to find the global optimum.
Complexity is O(n)

**Tabu-Search**

Inspects the neighbordhood of a random initialized configuration and chooses the one with smallest error. Places the 
previous feature one the tabu list to avoid circling. Terminates if no better solution in neighborhood.
Might stuck around a local optimum if tabu list is too small. Complexity depends on the length of tabu list but in average 
lesser than Neighbordhood-Search. 

**Greedy-Search**

Iteratively adds new features to the dataset by choosing those with the smallest error. Terminates if overall error 
havenÂ´t decreased since X iterations. 

**SMAC-Search**

This Model uses SMACv3 (probs to the autoML girls and guys from Uni Freiburg) to find the optimal Selection of features.
